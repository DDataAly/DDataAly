## Hi there 👋
### I'm Aly :relaxed: I'm a newbie to the world of coding, but I'm passionate about all things Data and hope to become a Data Engineer one day :sunrise_over_mountains:  
#### Planning to go the whole path one step at the time, and will add my projects along the way  :beginner:
#### This is what I'm learning right now 🌱:
- SQL 
  <br>
- Python 
  <br>
- Tableau 

Self-starter and self-learner with the Engineering degree. I switched my career to Data Analytics this year, and I discovered that I really enjoy writing SQL scripts. Then I discovered that I enjoy writing Python programs, too. Now I'm working hard to build up my level in both Python and SQL, learn basics of Computer Science and become a true profi!
